#  EV Adoption Forecasting

# Project Overview
As electric vehicle (EV) adoption surges, urban planners and policymakers need to anticipate infrastructure requirementsâ€”especially the demand for EV charging stations. Inadequate planning can lead to bottlenecks, affecting user experience and hindering sustainability goals.

This project aims to **forecast future EV adoption trends** using historical EV registration data. The insights from this model can help in **planning charging infrastructure, resource allocation, and policy development**.


# Problem Statement
Using an electric vehicle dataset (containing information on EV populations, vehicle types, and historical charging usage), build a **regression-based predictive model** to forecast the **number of electric vehicles in upcoming years** based on historical trends in EV growth, vehicle types, and regional data.


# Goal
- Develop a **regression model** that predicts future EV adoption demand.
- Analyze historical EV registration data to identify trends.
- Provide **forecasting results** that can guide sustainable infrastructure planning.


# Dataset Details
The dataset represents the number of vehicles registered by the **Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL)**, with monthly records from **January 2017 to February 2024**. It includes:

- **Date:** Monthly registration date.
- **County:** Geographic region within the state.
- **State:** Region associated with the record.
- **Vehicle Primary Use:** (Passenger: 83%, Truck: 17%).
- **Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs):** Vehicles powered solely by onboard batteries.
- **Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs):** Vehicles powered partially by onboard batteries.
- **Electric Vehicle (EV) Total:** Sum of BEVs and PHEVs.
- **Non-Electric Vehicle Total:** Vehicles that are not electric.
- **Total Vehicles:** All powered vehicles (including EVs).
- **Percent Electric Vehicles:** Percentage of EVs compared to total registered vehicles.



# Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries Used:**  
  - `pandas` for data manipulation  
  - `numpy` for numerical computations  
  - `matplotlib` / `seaborn` for visualization  
  - `scikit-learn` for regression modeling
